# Il2CppThriftGen
Il2CppThriftGen helps you generate .thrift files from C# POCOs so you can use the thrift generator to create working Thrift classes.

The current intended use is to use this with Il2cppInspector however in the future this will be adapted to take already C# exported classes.

## Todo

- [ ] Output a clean structured .thrift file

- [ ] Take parameters via the CLI
